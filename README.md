## 🧑‍💻 **Advanced Concepts**

### 🔍 1. **Data Fetching with `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps`**
   - Dynamically fetch data on each request using `getServerSideProps`.
   - For faster performance, pre-render pages with `getStaticProps` and update them using ISR.

### 🎨 2. **Styling with Tailwind CSS**
   - **Tailwind CSS** allows for highly customizable, responsive designs without writing CSS from scratch.
   
### 🌍 3. **API Routes and Middleware**
   - Built-in API routes provide a serverless way to handle back-end logic directly in your Next.js application.

### 🗺️ 4. **Optimizing Performance with Images**
   - **Next.js Image Optimization** improves load times and enhances user experience by serving responsive, compressed images.

### ⚙️ 5. **Custom Configuration with `next.config.js`**
   - Set up custom webpack, environment variables, redirects, and rewrites in `next.config.js`.
